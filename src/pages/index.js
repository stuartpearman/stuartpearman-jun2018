      <p>I love transforming <strong>complex problems into simple ones</strong> – whether that's integrating a scattered ecosystem on the backend, automating a tedious daily task, or visualizing intimidating data in a digestible way. I've created and researched dashboard software, educational tools, publishing platforms, and more.</p>
      <p>My approach to software development looks a lot like traditional <a href="#">research and problem solving</a>. I like to tackle difficult problems and that means I'm constantly up against challenges I've never dealt with before. Relying on prior knowledge won't get me far in these situations.</p>
      <p>I prefer to trust <a href="#">processes and documentation</a> over my own memory. Not only do I forget things, but those things change over time – especially in the world of web and software development. A process is greater than a template, and a notebook stores information better than my brain. If I can store and access the things I learn in an effective way, my brain can be free to do work on the task at hand.</p>
      <p>Over time, I've found that poor communication and planning is a greater project killer than lack of expertise or resources. As an answer to this, I've developed my own <a href="#">simplified agile workflow</a>. It allows me to give better estimates, honestly communicate status and uncertainty, and protect the project from scope creep and other pitfalls in the development lifecycle.</p>
