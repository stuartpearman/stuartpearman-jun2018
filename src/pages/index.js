      <p>Professional Javascript developer and full-stack software engineer.</p>

    <p>My approach to software development is heavily intertwined with research and documentation due to a crappy memory. It means I'm constantly refreshing and improving upon my own processes and tools. It allows me to look at each new piece of software as a its own unique challenge, and adapt to the project's evolving needs.</p>
    <p>I love to create tools that **simplify complex problems** – like integrating a scattered ecosystem on the backend, automating a tedious daily task, or visualizing intimidating data in a digestible way. I've created and researched dashboard software, educational tools, publishing platforms, and more.</p>

    <p>Agile software development is a natural fit for me, and over time, I've developed my own, simplified Scrum workflow. This allows me to give better estimates, communicate status and uncertainty honestly, and protect the project from scope creep and other pitfalls in the development lifecycle.</p>
