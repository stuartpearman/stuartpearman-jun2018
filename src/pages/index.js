        My approach to software development is heavily intertwined with{' '}
        <a href="#">research and documentation</a> due to a crappy memory. It
        means I'm constantly refreshing and improving upon my own processes and
        tools. It allows me to look at each new piece of software as a its own
        unique challenge, and adapt to the project's evolving needs.

      <p>
        I love to create tools that <strong>simplify complex problems</strong> –
        like integrating a scattered ecosystem on the backend, automating a
        tedious daily task, or visualizing intimidating data in a digestible
        way. I've created and researched{' '}
        <strong>
          dashboard software, educational tools, publishing platforms, and more
        </strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Agile software development is a natural fit for me, and over time, I've
        developed my own, simplified Scrum workflow. This allows me to give
        better estimates, honestly communicate status and uncertainty, and
        protect the project from scope creep and other common pitfalls.
