        <p>Lead the development and technical planning in an overhaul / redesign for a mid-sized web development agency website.</p>

        <h3 id="descriptionofwork">Description of work</h3>

        <p>Uses webhooks on internal servers to listen for changes in data from a number of API's and static files. When data is updated, the application uses a build server built on Node to combine and compile the data into a static React application, keeping all information secure and contained within the organization's internal network.</p>

        <p>Started work on the application during its inception in 2014 &amp; '15, laying down much of the initial frontend infrastructure and design implementation.

        <p>Worked independently on a dashboard to integrate with a large hospital network's data analytics platform.</p>

        <h3 id="descriptionofwork-2">Description of work</h3>

        <p>Created a dashboard to solve navigation issues the client was having with their data analytics software. The application used a TurboTax-like approach, asking users a series of questions to direct them to the correct dataset or visualization. The project was constrained in that it required a static, single file output to integrate with their existing toolset.</p>
